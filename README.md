# üèñÔ∏è Vacation Vault

A simple app for keeping track of vacations. Built with the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/).

## Features

- Create Vacations
- Upload and caption images
- Add Journal Entries
- Sign-in page doubles as registration page if new email entered

## Notes

- Dates are all UTC, I didn't worry about timezones for this exercise (a library like `luxon` would help for this which I've used before )
- Photos are just uploaded to the `/upload` folder for simplicity of development and testing for now. Would use something like an S3 bucket in production.
- I used a combination of server actions and TRPC for different parts of the app to showcase both.
- Auth Pages (sign-in and sign-out) come from NextAuth
- Migrations would be handled by Prisma. See the commands in `package.json`

## Ideas for Next Steps

- Add maps and location tagging for destination and images.
